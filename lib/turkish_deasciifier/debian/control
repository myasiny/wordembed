Description: deasciify a given Turkish text
 This class helps to deasciify Turkish texts. If a Turkish text is written 
 using only ASCII letters, that is not including any Turkish letters, then
 by using the methods of this class it is possible to convert that text into 
 a correct form, that includes corresponding Turkish letters. It cannot do this 
 perfectly but works most of the time.
